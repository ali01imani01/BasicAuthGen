# BasicAuthGen
Generate base64 payloads for BasicAuth brute force attack from a given username and password list :)

## Usage:
```
bash basicauthgen.sh -u ul.txt -p pw.txt
```
- final output: `readytoattack.txt` (contains usernames & passwords in base64 form)

- I've also added a small username and password list which you can use.
